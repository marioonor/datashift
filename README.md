# GRC Gap Analysis Automation Tool

This Java Spring Boot application automates the process of gap analysis in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) and compliance by scanning PDF documents submitted by clients. It uses keyword matching to identify relevant information and collect evidence, streamlining the audit and assessment process.

## Overview

This application provides the following key functionalities:

* **Document Submission:** Clients can securely upload PDF documents through a user-friendly interface (if a UI is implemented) or via API.
* **Keyword-Based Scanning:** The system allows administrators to define keywords and phrases relevant to specific GRC frameworks, regulations, or compliance standards.
* **Automated Evidence Collection:** Upon document submission, the application automatically scans the content for the defined keywords. When a keyword is found, the surrounding context (e.g., paragraph, sentence) is extracted as potential evidence.
* **Gap Identification (Implicit):** By highlighting the presence or absence of keywords related to specific requirements, the application implicitly aids in identifying potential gaps in compliance.
* **Evidence Management:** The collected evidence is stored and can be reviewed, annotated, and linked to specific requirements or controls.
* **Reporting:** The application can generate reports summarizing the findings, including the documents scanned, keywords matched, and extracted evidence.

## Technologies Used

* **Java:** The primary programming language.
* **Spring Boot:** A framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based Applications.
* **PDF Processing Library:** (Specify the library used, e.g., Apache PDFBox, iText) for extracting text content from PDF documents.
* **Database:** (Specify the database used, e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, H2) for storing application data, keywords, evidence, and reports.
* **JPA/Hibernate:** (If used) For object-relational mapping and database interaction.
* **RESTful APIs:** For external communication and potential integration with other systems.
* **Security:** (Specify security measures, e.g., Spring Security) for authentication and authorization.
* **Build Tool:** (Specify the build tool, e.g., Maven, Gradle) for project building and dependency management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have a compatible JDK installed on your system (version X or higher recommended).
* **Maven or Gradle:** Make sure you have Maven or Gradle installed, depending on the project's build configuration.
* **Database:** Set up an instance of the configured database (see "Technologies Used").

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

2.  **Configure Database:**
    * Navigate to the `src/main/resources` directory.
    * Open the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.
    * Update the database connection details (URL, username, password) to match your database setup.

3.  **Build the Application:**
    * **Using Maven:**
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        ```
    * **Using Gradle:**
        ```bash
        ./gradlew clean build
        ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    * **Using Maven:**
        ```bash
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```
    * **Using Gradle:**
        ```bash
        ./gradlew bootRun
        ```

    The application should now be running on the configured port (default is usually 8085).

## Usage

(Provide a brief overview of how to use the application. This will depend on whether you have a UI or are primarily using APIs.)

### If a UI is Implemented:

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to the application's URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
2.  Log in with your credentials (if authentication is enabled).
3.  Navigate to the "Upload Documents" section and upload the PDF files you want to scan.
4.  Go to the "Manage Keywords" section to define or view the keywords used for scanning.
5.  Access the "Scan Results" or "Evidence" section to review the extracted evidence and identified potential gaps.
6.  Generate reports as needed from the "Reports" section.

### If Primarily Using APIs:

Refer to the API documentation (if available) for instructions on how to interact with the application's endpoints for document submission, keyword management, initiating scans, and retrieving results.

## Configuration

The application's behavior can be configured through the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. Some key configurations include:

* **Database Settings:** Connection details for the database.
* **Server Port:** The port on which the application runs.
* **File Upload Settings:** Maximum file size, allowed file types (if applicable).
* **Keyword Matching Options:** (If any specific configurations are available, e.g., case-insensitive matching).
* **Security Settings:** Authentication and authorization configurations.
